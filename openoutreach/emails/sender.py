    The mailbox's signature and the opt-out block
    are appended to ``body`` here rather than at the call sites, so every send —
    opener and follow-up — carries both, in the order body → signature →
    opt-out. The matching ``List-Unsubscribe`` header goes on the
    same message: header and body line are two halves of one opt-out, and only
    building them together makes it impossible to ship one without the other.

    **The send joins the mail log before it is attempted**, and what the receiver
    answers is recorded against it: an ``accepted`` event carrying the SMTP queue
    id, or a ``rejected``/``deferred``/``error`` one carrying the refusal. A send
    that is never accepted therefore leaves a row saying so, which is what makes
    "what is my bounce rate?" arithmetic rather than an opinion.

    ``bcc`` (when set) blind-copies the operator's own address so they keep a
    private record of every send; ``send_message`` strips the Bcc header before
    transmission, so the To recipient never sees it. Call sites get it from
    ``operator_bcc`` rather than deciding for themselves.

    ``in_reply_to``/``references`` thread a reply onto an existing email thread
    (both are prior Message-IDs); ``thread`` puts the row in that conversation
    directly, rather than making the log re-derive what the caller already knows.

    ``campaign`` decides whether the message *text* is logged as well as its
    metadata — see ``_sent_block``. It is passed rather than inferred from ``bcc``,
    which is ``None`` both on freemium campaigns and on an operator who never set
    an address; keying off it would silently drop the log for the second.
