"""Who is running this daemon.

Self-hosted means one operator, so identity is a lookup, not a parameter. This
replaces the ``OperatorSession`` object that used to be threaded through every
call: it was the browser era's session handle, and once the browser went there was
nothing session-like left in it — just the Django ``User`` and the campaign the
handler happened to be working on. The campaign now rides on the deal (a real FK),
and the operator is looked up here.

Nothing is cached across calls. Both reads are a single indexed row and happen at
most once per cycle; a cache would only add a way for a renamed operator to keep
signing emails with their old name until the daemon restarts.
