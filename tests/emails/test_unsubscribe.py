# tests/emails/test_unsubscribe.py
"""Opt-out: the advertised mechanism, both detection paths, and the enforcement.

The three legs, and what each one locks down:

  * **Advertised** — every send carries the ``List-Unsubscribe`` header *and* a
    visible reply-line. The header is what receiving filters read; the line
    reaches the clients that render no unsubscribe button of their own. Both are
    asserted on the same message, since either alone leaves someone with no exit
    but the spam button.
  * **Detected** — a client-generated unsubscribe (no threading headers, found
    box-wide by the ``+unsub`` alias during the mail pass) and a worded one
    (threads normally, read by the outreach agent) both reach the same suppression.
  * **Enforced** — suppression binds to the person, so every lead holding the
    address is disqualified and every open deal closes at UNSUBSCRIBED, while an
    already-closed deal keeps the outcome that closed it.
